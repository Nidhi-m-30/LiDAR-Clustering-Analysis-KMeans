# LiDAR Clustering Analysis using KMeans

This repository demonstrates how LiDAR data, such as those used in autonomous vehicles, can be affected by challenges like outliers and overlapping clusters. The example code simulates these scenarios and showcases the impact on data clustering when applying the KMeans algorithm from scikit-learn.

---

## Overview
Autonomous systems rely heavily on precise environmental perception. However, various factors, such as overlapping objects or environmental noise (e.g., mud, rain, or outliers in LiDAR readings), can lead to misclassifications. This project simulates these conditions to:

1. Visualize overlapping data clusters.
2. Inject outliers into the dataset.
3. Analyze clustering outcomes and identify misclassified points using KMeans.

---

## Features
- **Synthetic LiDAR Data Generation**: Simulates clusters of data points with intentional overlaps and variations.
- **Outlier Injection**: Randomly generated outliers emulate unexpected environmental disturbances.
- **KMeans Clustering**: Clusters the data and compares results to the ground truth.
- **Visualization**: Highlights clustered points, misclassified points, and outliers in a detailed 2D plot.

---

## Technologies Used
- Python 3.7+
- NumPy: Data generation and manipulation.
- Matplotlib: Data visualization.
- scikit-learn: KMeans clustering implementation.

---

The script will:
1. Simulate LiDAR data clusters and add random outliers.
2. Apply KMeans clustering to the data.
3. Visualize:
   - Predicted clusters (colored differently).
   - Misclassified points (highlighted in red).
   - Outliers (highlighted in blue).

---

## Example Visualization
A plot generated from the script showcases:

1. Clustered points based on KMeans output.
2. Outliers marked in **blue**.
3. Misclassified points marked in **red** with a black edge.
